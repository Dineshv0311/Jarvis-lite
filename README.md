# 🧠 Jarvis-lite: Offline AI Voice Assistant

**Jarvis-lite** is a smart, extendable, and privacy-friendly voice assistant built using **Python**, **Speech Recognition**, **Text-to-Speech**, and **Ollama's local LLMs** (like LLaMA, Mistral, etc.). Think of it as your very own Jarvis — but running entirely on your machine.

> 🗣️ Just say what you need. 🧠 Let your local AI think. 🔊 And hear the response — instantly.
